## A simple react & typescript boilerplate

Bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Pre-configured with:

- eslint
- prettier
- husky
- router
- react-hook-form & yup

### Setting up

`npm install` or `yarn` installs the dependencies,

`npm run dev` starts the app in development mode.

### Husky

Run once before first commit:

`npm run prepare` 

it sets up a pre-commit hook that lints & prettifies code before every commit.
